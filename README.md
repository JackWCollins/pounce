# Pounce Web
This is the web component of the PouncePro prototype. Here, users can have a little more power with their client workflows.
Their active clients are listed on the left hand side, with the main workspace in the middle. Agents can quickly schedule showings, review client priorities with the sale, and review basic client contact info. The right pane houses the messages and notifications that go back and forth between the client and agent. 
Overall, this tool can streamline agent workflows and improve the buying and selling experience for clients.
